 Selection of the last 3 products of the last order carried out on Vtex, avoiding duplication of products in case one of them is purchased more than once.

 Instead of focusing on the last 3 orders, this time the code selects the last 3 order items, of the last order, avoiding repetion in the selection so as to not present the same product more than once in a personalized message with Dynamic Content.

 This was requested by the client Bisturi.
